                    <h2>I. Summary of our Stream</h2>
                    <p>Group 5's stream took place on February 24, 2022 and was streamed on Twitch using Lorenzo's account. While the stream was all about Valorant, the title didn't really have any connection to the stream itself. As for what happened during the stream, it was mainly gameplay with friends while our communication was audible. Because of the schedule provided to us, we had to use it to our advantage by collaborating with another group that was also live streaming on twitch.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answers" id="b">
                    <h2>II. Strengths of our Stream</h2>
                    <p>Strength of our Content: The strengths of our stream is that our host and his friends play valorant with a lot of teamwork and having a lot of fun. They show us the strength of teamwork and communication throughout the game. The way that the players are chatting and trying to help other players to find a plan to win the game. The players are giving the other player a better weapon so they have a chance to win.</p>
                    <p>Strength of our Live Stream (Technical side): The video and audio was clear. We have a bot that would help our moderators do their task easier, and the bot could also give information about the music that was currently playing.</p>

                    <h2>III. Areas of Opportunities for our Stream</h2>
                    <p>Based on what we saw and what we got from the feedback forms we had a lot to work on to improve our stream. The things we needed to improve on are the engagement between the streamer and the audience, the audio values (music, in-game volume, and communications), adding a face cam and/or hand cam, and following the schedule more strictly. We are already taking action in going through these improvements. The audio values and the face cam/hand cam would be the first things that we'd improve because they are the easiest to add/fix. When it comes to the engagement and the schedule, that would be improved by the streamer themselves.</p>

                    <h2>IV. Analysis of the Engagement of our Viewers</h2>
                    <p>Based on the information that we got on our Twitch's Creator Dashboard there were 8 users that were chatting on stream and there were a total of 72 messages on chat. The number of messages in chat peaked at 13 messages at 1:40pm. During the stream we gained 1 additional follower at 1:35pm. When it comes to the data that we received from our feedback form, in the 10 viewers that answered our feedback form, everyone enjoyed our stream and most of them gave pointers as to what we can improve on (stated above). </p>

                    <h2>V. Analysis of the Viewership of Our Stream</h2>
                    <p>We peaked at 26 viewers and 11 of them are actively chatting in that stream, surprisingly based on the information we got on twitch we had a viewer from Ireland in our stream. Just like we stated on the previous number, everyone that answered our feedback form enjoyed the stream but this also shows that not everyone that watched our stream answered our feedback form.</p>
