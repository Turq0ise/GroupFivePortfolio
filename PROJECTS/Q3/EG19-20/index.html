                    <h2>I. Summary of our Stream</h2>
                    <p>Group 5's stream took place on February 24, 2022 and was streamed on Twitch using Lorenzo's account. While the stream was all about Valorant, the title didn't really have any connection to the stream itself. As for what happened during the stream, it was mainly gameplay with friends while our communication was audible. Because of the schedule provided to us, we had to use it to our advantage by collaborating with another group that was also live streaming on twitch.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answers" id="b">
                    <h2>II. Strengths of our Stream</h2>
                    <p>Strength of our Content: Our hosts and his friends play Valorant while continuously showing a lot of collaboration and enjoyment throughout the duration of the game, which is one of our stream's major strengths. Throughout the game, they demonstrate the importance of teamwork and communication. They were able to play smoothly, managed to practice EOP as much as possible, and kept the livestream from getting monotonous. (As proof of this, watch from 16:00 until the end of the gameplay.)</p>
                    <p>The way the players were speaking and attempting to assist one another in devising a strategy to win the game such as providing a better weapon to the other player in order for them to have a chance to win is evident in the way that the players have the chance to do this often. Because they play this game together so frequently, there is a spontaneous and almost genuine exchange of communication between the players shown in the entirety of the stream that they have learned to make the broadcast feel as if it were made by actual live streamers.</p>
                    <p>Strength of our Live Stream (Technical side): The video and audio were both in excellent condition. The video game music can be heard all throughout the stream as well as the intermission music and the playerâ€™s screen can be seen clearly. We have a bot that can assist our moderators with their tasks and can also provide information about the music that is currently being played.</p>

                <div class="answers" id="c">
                    <h2>III. Areas of Opportunities for our Stream</h2>
                    <p>We have a lot of work to do to improve our stream predicated on what we saw and what we learned through the feedback forms. Because the responses were so varied, the items we needed to work on, according to the respondents, were the following: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The engagement between the streamers and the audience</li>
                        <li>The audio values (music, in-game volume, and communications)</li>
                        <li>Adding a face cam and/or hand cam; and</li>
                        <li>Following the schedule more strictly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We are already taking action in going through these improvements. The audio values and the face cam/hand cam would be the first things that we would improve because they are the easiest to add/fix. When it comes to the engagement and the schedule, that would be improved by the streamer themselves. Because switching from another window while playing an ongoing game is difficult, the hosts were unable to engage with the audience as much as they would have liked. The reason for the lack of a camera from the hosts is because there was a problem with the connection of the camera. We were a little bit late with starting the stream because the preparation for broadcasting took longer than intended which correlates to why the music also started playing late.</p>

                    <h2>IV. Analysis of the Engagement of our Viewers</h2>
                    <p>Based on the information that we got on our Twitch's Creator Dashboard there were 8 users that were chatting on stream and there were a total of 72 messages on chat. The number of messages in chat peaked at 13 messages at 1:40pm. During the stream we gained 1 additional follower at 1:35pm. When it comes to the data that we received from our feedback form, in the 10 viewers that answered our feedback form, everyone enjoyed our stream and most of them gave pointers as to what we can improve on (stated above).</p>

                    <h2>V. Analysis of the Viewership of Our Stream</h2>
                    <p>We peaked at 26 viewers and 11 of them are actively chatting in that stream, surprisingly based on the information we got on twitch we had a viewer from Ireland in our stream. Just like we stated on the previous number, everyone that answered our feedback form enjoyed the stream but this also shows that not everyone that watched our stream answered our feedback form.</p>
