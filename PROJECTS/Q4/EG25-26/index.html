                    <h2>I. What were the things well done during the stream? Explain why you think they were well done.</h2>
                    <p>The things that we did better on this stream compared to the previous one are communication with the viewers, and the mood of the stream. In this stream Lorenzo was able to communicate more with the viewers by talking to them through chat (this will be explained later). The mood for this stream was more lively because everyone in our livestream was more active and got used to talking whilst being live.</p>

                    <h2>II. What are the areas of opportunities for your stream? Explain why you think they are areas of opportunity.</h2>
                    <p>The things we need to improve on are fixing the mic issue, and our internal communication. As mentioned in the previous question, “Lorenzo was able to communicate more with the viewers by talking to them through chat” and the main reason for this is during the first game Lorenzo lowered down the audio of his mic (in OBS) and forgot to increase it again. In the entirety of the stream, Lorenzo was barely audible and no one in the live stream mentioned it. It was only made aware to us after the stream when we checked our group chat when one of our group members mentioned it (Icy) but it was already too late. How we could improve this is by making sure that everything is already set before starting the actual live stream and reminding everyone in the group that it is best to forward these types of concerns in the live stream chat to make it easier for our host (Lorenzo) to read it.</p>

                    <h2>III. What is the level of engagement during the stream?</h2>
                    <p>We think that the level of engagement for our stream is better compared to the previous one. Our main reason for this would be the number of chat messages, chatters (users that typed a message), and new followers. Our chat messages decreased from 72 to 50 but our chatters increased from 8 to 9 and our new followers from 1 to 4. For the decrease in chat messages, there are two possible reasons as to why this happened, the inaudible mic volume from our host and the duration of our livestream from 2 hours to 1 hour. Joel was one of the members that was accompanying Lorenzo in the game and said that Lorenzo was speaking more and reacting to the messages he saw in his chat box but because of his mic volume, our stream was not able to recognize it.</p>

                    <h2>IV. How did the level of engagement affect the overall performance of the stream?</h2>
                    <p>In our opinion, a better level of engagement would mean a more entertaining live stream and the viewers would feel more connected. But based on the feedback that we got, everyone (even the ones that were not in the actual live stream) said that they enjoyed it. We think there are two main reasons as to why this is, our type of content and our initial idea. Gaming is the type of content where communicating with your viewers can be set to a minimum and the viewers will still watch it for the game. For our initial idea, this was the collaboration between two groups. This idea started as a method of convenience for all of the members that was playing in the livestream, this helped them in getting more comfortable with having people watching and after the first live stream, communication was also comfortable between the players and I think that is also one of the reasons as to why everyone enjoyed the stream, members of the collaborating group were also considered as hosts to our stream.</p>

                    <h2>V. What is your level of viewership? Explain the reason why you have high or low viewership.</h2>
                    <p>We had a lower level of viewership from a peak of 11 to a peak of 9 and 75 total live views. We would not be able to give a concrete reason as to why this is but we have our speculations. Shorter live stream duration, we didn’t reach people that were interested in our content, and a filled up schedule. As we’ve said previously, the stream duration was decreased from 2 hours to 1 hour because it was a Saturday and other sections also had live streams. It is also possible that when we posted our promotional material on our social media platforms, the people that saw it weren't really interested in our content. Finally, our schedule for this live stream was 2-3pm and within this schedule two other sections were also going live so we had a lot of competition and it is possible that their content was more favorable to the people they were able to reach.Q4</p>
