                    <p>People who are bored, especially if they don’t have anything to do. They are in need of entertainment to help them pass the time.</p>

                    <h2>b. Define</h2>
                    <p>Boredness is the topic we chose to tackle but you can’t really solve it. Although we can provide solutions to help them do something to get rid of boredom. Our possible solution is to entertain them with the restrictions of them not being able to go outside.</p>

                    <h2>c. Ideate</h2>
                    <p>When people are bored, they tend to do something random. Watch anything from their recommended section in youtube, or scroll through their social media. They will try to find something that’ll hopefully interest them.</p>

                    <p>We intend to recommend well-written underrated movies and shows for TV entertainment, as well as various music genres and game categories that are appropriate for the person’s liking.</p>

                    <p>Trying out different hobbies can entertain you</p>
                    <p>Having a person watch some famous movies, exciting gameplays, or listen to all famous songs and check if the person likes it (feedback).</p>
                    <p>Learning new things such as cooking and crafting can also be a good hobby who knows u might have a golden touch in one of those</p>
                    <p>We're going to ask people about what they like the most; related to TV shows, films, music, and gameplays.</p>
