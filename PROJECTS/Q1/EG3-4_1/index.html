                    <h2>a. Naruto/Anime</h2>

                    <h3>About:</h3>
                    <p>“Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.”</p>

                    <h3>Demographics:</h3>
                    <p>Most teens around the age of 13 and above watch this show since it has been known as a PG-13 anime show; but there is a little bit of something for everyone in every age. Regarding gender identity, I'm going to base the percentage using the male fanbase about Genre Preferences. Since Naruto consists of various genres such as Shounen, Martial Arts, Adventure, Comedy which I have gathered, here are some of the percentage from the male fanbase in each genre:</p>
                    <p>Shounen: 66.4%, Martial Arts: 74.0%, Adventure: 65.9%, Comedy: 65.7%</p>
                    <p>“Naruto is the fourth best-selling manga series in history, selling 250 million copies worldwide in 46 countries, with 153 million of the sales in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.”</p>

                    <h3>Culture:</h3>
                    <p>“In Japanese culture, anime is actually a term for any mass-produced animation, Japanese or non-Japanese. And, importantly, in Japan, anime is not just culture for kids. Rather, anime series like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Attack on Titan, Death Note, and Cowboy Bebop were all hugely successful amongst adults too.”</p>
                    <p>From: <a href="https://www.superprof.com/blog/what-is-japanese-anime/" target="_blank">www.superprof.com</a></p>

                    <h3>Beliefs:</h3>
                    <p>“Historians believe anime artists may have been influenced by early Western cartoon characters, such as Betty Boop and Mickey Mouse. Don't think of anime simply as Japanese versions of American cartoons, though. They're quite different in several important ways”</p>

                    <h2>c. Project PALM</h2>
                    <p>Most of the listeners will be students because the podcasts were made to aid their education during the pandemic. Based on my research, most if not all schools that are part of SDO-Cagayan are public schools, from preschool through high school. According to Wikipedia, “They are ethnically and linguistically diverse, with a substrate of Agtas, Negritos who are food-gatherers with no fixed abodes, overlaid by Ilongots and others in a number of tribes, some of whom were fierce head-hunters (they have given up the practice), with the latest but largest element of the population being the Ilocanos, closely followed by the Ibanags.”.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Culture:</h3>
                    <p>According to wikipedia the culture of ilocanos is not that different from the culture that we have today in the modern day. Before ilocanos would kill animals because there is a spirit called anito and they also believed that mythological creatures such as giants existed</p>

                    <h3>Beliefs:</h3>
                    <p>According to Wikipedia, “Most Ilocanos are Roman Catholics, and Aglipayans, which originated in Ilocos Norte. During the Pre-Hispanic era, Ilocanos were animists who believed in spirits called anito who were either bad or good, male or female.”</p>
