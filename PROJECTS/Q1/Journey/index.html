                    <p>Streaming refers to any media content (live or recorded) that is delivered to computers, phones or any other devices that can connect to the internet.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="answers" id="d">
                    <h2>d. Viewers Analysis for each Streaming category</h2>
                    <p>We chose three streaming categories which are Anime (Naruto), Gaming (League of Legends), and Education (Project PALM).</p>
                    <p>The first streaming category is Naruto, it's an anime and we researched the gist of the story and provided that information. We also provided the age range of the viewers by basing it on the genre. Lastly, is how much the anime gained profit and its type of beliefs that the anime used throughout the show.</p>
                    <p>The second streaming category is LOL(League of legends). We first researched what type of game it is and when it was initially released. Next was, how popular is it on streaming platforms, who are the content creators that made LOL popular, how many viewers watch LOL, and in what countries is it popular. Lastly, we researched about the player count of LOL, what age are the players, and what are their common beliefs.</p>
                    <p>The third streaming category is Project PALM. It is a podcast made by the teachers of SDO-Cagayan and made for the students of SDO-Cagayan to aid their education during this pandemic. Most of the students of that school based on the population are Ilocanos and Ibanags. Since most of the students are Ilocanos we referred to Ilocano's belief, culture and common religion.</p>

                    <h2>e. Need of the viewers</h2>
                    <p>The needs of the viewers are good video quality, good audio quality, good internet connection, entertainment, the feeling of “ in the moment”, interacting with family, friends, or even a global audience and viewing live streamers to connect to their own favourite live streamers.</p>

                <div class="answers" id="f">
                    <h2>f. Characteristics of a good stream</h2>
                    <p>Many content producers have turned to streaming as a method to express their ideas, reach out to others, and even as a profession or source of revenue, particularly in the areas of entertainment. Others opt to start their own streaming journey since streaming has become a key medium or source of influence for many individuals. Now, various qualities are essential to consider when a person decides to create their own content since recognizing these characteristics make a person's streams appear presentable, efficient, reliable and appealing. But what makes a good stream? </p>
                    <p>If someone were to make their own streaming content, here are some things to consider that I believe would help beginners become more efficient streamers:</p>
                    <li><span>Watch content like a streamer.</span> I think the best way to begin one's streaming journey is to draw on inspiration from content creators that you look up to and learn from the flow of their stream, for example, or how they would handle their audience and similar things like that. <sup>1</sup>Prioritize streamer over content since a consistent streamer is much more reliable than leaning on specific stream content.</li>
                    <li><span>Make content for yourself.</span> What I mean by this is <sup>1</sup>talking about the reasons or motivations behind why a streamer decides to go live. Stream to have fun. It is much easier to stick with streamers who clearly enjoy themselves and what they  do. When a streamer makes content with the intention of it being liked by others, it loses some of its appeal. You do it for yourself because you love it and it is something you enjoy doing and you're not doing it for other people.</li>
                    <li><span>Active interaction environment.</span> A healthy, active interaction with your audience is always important as it: 1) <sup>2</sup>Allows viewers to take control of what they want to know during a live streaming session. 2) Doesn't stop at asking audiences what they want to see or hear. 3) Enables streamers to get immediate feedback and answer burning viewer questions. But it can also provide an unintended benefit as well: collecting ideas for future live videos.</li>
                    <li><span>Respect your audience.</span> <sup>1</sup>This means having the flexibility to be able to work with a range of viewers and properly saying farewell to the ones who don't want to work with you.</li>
                    <li><span>Ask.</span> This kind of resonates with the third characteristic but as broad as it may be, when I say ask, I'm pertaining to any type of questions that a streamer would ask their audience whether it's about asking for any rooms of improvement, asking them for content they would like to see from you, or even ask them what they're feeling regardless of the content. <sup>2</sup>As Revlo non active chat is a good way to determine the health of your community – and your stream.</li>
